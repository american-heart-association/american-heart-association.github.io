            <h1>Couple kept faith as their baby neared death/h1>
            <p class="sub" > Transplant saved him </p>
            <p>
                Rikki and Greg Myers were excited to hear whether their first child would be a boy or a girl.<br><br>
                
                Yet when the doctor spoke, the only words that mattered were, "Your baby has formed only half a heart."<br><br>
                
                The test showed their baby boy had hypoplastic left heart syndrome. With HLHS, the left side of the heart doesn't
                develop properly while in the womb, making it impossible
                 for the left ventricle – responsible for pumping freshly oxygenated blood out to the rest of the body – to function properly.<br><br>
                
                Without immediate intervention, the congenital heart defect is fatal, usually within the first few days or weeks of life.<br><br>
                
                                       
                Children born with HLHS typically undergo a set of three surgical procedures in the first few days, months and years after birth. 
                The goal is to stabilize the heart and reconstruct it so it can pump blood with only one ventricle.<br><br>

               As soon as Skylar was born in April 2008, he was rushed to the neonatal intensivecare unit and hooked up to machines                                                                                                                                                  
               to help keep him alive until his first surgery.<br><br>
                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                               
              Rikki and Greg were told if Skylar didn't have a heart transplant, he would have seven to 10 days to live.<br>
              Six days into what Rikki called "the hardest week we've been through," <br.<br>
                                                                   
              Dr. Larry Watts, walked into Skylar's hospital room and said, 
              "Well, Mom and Dad, you're going to have a long night. Dorian is getting a heart." <br><br>
            
             When Skylar came out of the operating room the next morning,
            he looked like a whole new kid.<br><br> 

            "He'd been a blue baby all that time, and now everything was pink.
            Even his nail beds."  <br> <br> 
                
            Skylar went home the next week.<br>
                                                                                                                                 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="box2" >
            <h1>Dorian Today...</h1>
            <p class="sub" > </p>
            <p>
                Skylar is now 26 and enrolled at University of California pursuing his master in journalism<br> <br>
                
               For years, Skylar has volunteered with causes related to heart disease, including the AHA.<br><br>

             Ten years ago, he claimed a school district record when he raised $2,800 in the American Heart Association's 
                Kids Heart Challenge (his fourth) at his High School in Danville, California.<br><br>

            </p>
            <img src="https://www.heart.org/-/media/images/news/sfth/0402skylarmyers10cropped.jpg?la=en&hash=FBF50209730318E9DA349FEAFB903C891ABACF31" >
            <p>
               Skylar often talks to other "students" along his high school AHA alumni community about children congenital heart 
                defect.<br><br>
                
             He helps friends or families going through heart surgery, or to donate to a children's hospital. 
             About 40,000 U.S. babies are born each year with a heart defect, about eight in every 1,000 babies.<br><br>

            "I want people to know that no matter what you have, or what you feel like, you're not alone," he said. 
            "You can do this."<br> <br>
